# Microsoft-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

This project is a time series analysis and linear regression modeling of Microsoft Corporationâ€™s (MSFT) stock price over the last five years. It serves as a hands-on demonstration of using Python for financial data analysis, trend forecasting, and basic predictive modeling. The core goal is to analyze long-term price movement trends of MSFT stock and predict a simple linear trajectory using machine learning (Linear Regression). 
By fitting a regression line to the historical closing prices, we can visually and mathematically understand how the stock has performed over a multi-year horizon.

Project Objectives
1. Fetch and prepare real-world stock data using yfinance.
2. Visualize raw and modeled stock price behavior.
3. Train a Linear Regression model to detect trends.
4. Predict and plot future-like price trends.
5. Measure model performance using standard regression error metrics.
6. Understand the mathematics and limitations behind the model.

Machine Learning Model Used : Linear Regression
Linear Regression is upervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (stock price) and an independent variable (date). It tries to fit the best straight line through the data points.

The model uses the equation of a straight line: **Price = (slope) * Date_ordinal + (intercept)**
Where:

The model finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of squared errors between actual and predicted prices.

Implementation Steps

1. Download Data: Fetches MSFT stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the past 5 years.

2. Preprocess Data: Extracts only the closing price and drops missing values.

3. Convert Date to Ordinal: Converts dates to ordinal format to use them as a numerical feature.

4. Train Linear Regression Model: Fits a simple linear regression model to predict stock prices based on ordinal dates.

5. Make Predictions: Uses the trained model to predict stock prices.

6. Evaluate Model Performance: Calculates metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

7. Visualizations:

    Plots actual vs. predicted prices.

    Residual plot to analyze errors.

    Histogram of residuals to assess error distribution.

    Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices.

Model Performance Metrics

The performance of the linear regression model is assessed using the following metrics:

1. R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

3. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

4. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE, representing error magnitude.

Limitations

Linear Assumption: Stock prices do not always follow a linear trend.

Ignoring Market Factors: The model does not account for external factors like earnings reports, economic conditions, or investor sentiment.

Over-simplification: Stock prices are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors beyond historical trends.
